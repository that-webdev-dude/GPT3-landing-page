# GPT3 Landing Page

### Design Concept

A beautiful landing page designed in Figma and distributed for free from [AR Shakir](https://www.arshakir.com/).
The page is entirely built in [React]() and finally deployed.

The web page follows a clean and modern design approach, using the right proportions of primary and secondary accent components, prompting the user to actions.
A dark theme together with light text and a vibrant primary color, creates a modern aesthetic ensuring "no distraction" for the user who needs to go through the content.
The styles are implemented entirely in CSS.

The navigation consists of several links that allow users to quickly navigate to different sections within the page. Smooth scrolling is implemented, making the navigation between section a more enjoiable experience.

The main content area is divided into different sections, each addressing a specific topic related to GPT3.
The sections are arranged vertically and follow a consistent layout throughout the page.
Each section has a header with a title, presented in a clear and concise manner.

The design prioritizes readability and ease of navigation, making it easy for users to understand the content.
The page is fully responsive and suitable to be viewed on all devices.
